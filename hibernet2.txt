
Hibernet is a java framework that simlifies the developement of java 
application to interact with the database.

pre-requicite:
1.core java
2.JDBC
3.DBMS

it is invented by Gavin King in 2001.
it is an open source ,lighweight,ORM(object relational mapping) tool.
Hibernet implements the specification of JPA(java persistence API) for data persistence.
is a non-inverse framework , means it wont forces to programmers to extend/implement any class
or interface.
any type of application can build with Hibernet framework.

JDBC API 

java CLass(object) ------>   JDBC API --------> DB

class program{
    class.forName("drivername);
    Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url,username,password);
    PrepareStatment stm = conn.prepareStatment(sql query);
    executeQuery();
    conn.close.
}


Hibernet API

java class(object) --------> Hibernet(ORM) -------> Db (XML,Annotation)

@Annotations:
1. @Entity
2. @Table
3. @id

9. @OneToOne
10. @OneToMany
11. @ManyToOne
12. @ManyToMany
13. @JoinColoumn



Fetch Type :

FetchType.LAZY : it fetches the child entities lazily, that is at the time of fetching parent entity it just fetch proxy(created by cglib 
or other utility) of the child entitites and when u access any property of child entity then it is actually fetch by hibernate.

lazy initialization improves performance by avoiding unnecessary computation and reduce memory requirement.

FetchType.EAGER : it fetches the child entities along with parent.
depend on the situation either one of this initialization can be used.

CasCade : it referse to the automatic persistence of related entities. when a change is made to an entity, such as an update
or deletion, the changes can be cascaded to related entities as well.
which is ORM tool used in java to map java classes to database tables.

@OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
different types.
cascade=CascadeType.ALL
cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST
cascade=CascadeType.MERGE
cascade=CascadeType.REMOVE
cascade=CascadeType.REFRESH
cascade=CascadeType.SAVE_UPDATE



HQL : hibernate query language is an object oriented query language similer to sql but instead of
operating on tables and columns hql works with persistent object and their properties.

hql queries are translated by hibernate into conventional sql queries which in turns perform action on database.

select * from student where id=30;

session.save(object);

session.get(student.class,101);
